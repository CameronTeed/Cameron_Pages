        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            Built with C++ on the G++ compiler for linux. This aplication outputs captured network packets for a set duration of time to a txt file. 
            Testing was done with python, by broadcasting packets to the network and capturing them with the application. The python script then compared the output of the application to the packets sent,
             and verified that the application was working correctly. 
        </p>

        <h2>Project Structure</h2>
        <Pr>
            The project is organized into modular components, following best practices for C++ development. Key functionalities are encapsulated using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
            Version control is implemented with Git, ensuring a systematic approach to project management and collaboration.
