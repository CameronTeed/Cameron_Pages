        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            Built with C++ on the G++ compiler for linux. This aplication outputs captured network packets for a set duration of time to a txt file. 
            Testing was done with python, by broadcasting packets to the network and capturing them with the Network Analyzer. The python script then compares the output of the application to the packets sent,
             and verifies that the application is working correctly. 
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>C++ Development with Linux</li>
            <li>File I/O</li>
            <li>Testing and Quality Assurance</li>
            <li>Python Scripting</li>

            <li>OOP</li>
            <li>Sockets</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How it works</h2> 
        <Pr>
           Uses the linux socket library to capture packets, and outputs them to a file. The application is run from the command line, and takes in a duration of time to capture packets for, and an output file name.
        </Pr> 

        <h2>Analyzing Packets</h2>
        <Pr>
           In order to capture packets, and output them to a file, we must understand how packets are structured. For IPv4 packets are made up of a header, a payload, and sometime a trailer. The header contains information about the packet, such as the source and destination IP address, and the payload contains the data being sent.
          
        </Pr>
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <Pr>
           Unit tests were conducted using google test (gtest), integration and functional tests were conducted using python, where data packets were broadcasted and searched for in the output file created by the network analyzer. Valgrind was used to ensure there were no memory leaks. 
          
        </Pr>

        <h2>Optimizing Performance</h2>
        <p>
            The application focuses on optimizing performance in capturing and processing network packets. Techniques such as efficient memory handling and low-level socket programming contribute to the overall speed and reliability of the network analyzer.
